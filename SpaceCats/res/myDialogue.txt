[TOMMY]
TOMMY: Hi V, Boss wanted me to show you how the new system works since the helpline's connection got messed up.
TOMMY: You can change the text on the screen by hitting the space bar and choose responses using the up and down arrows.
TOMMY: Once you've selected the option you want, just click space.
TOMMY: Helpline's still messed up though, so you only have so much time to respond.
TOMMY: And as a warning, Harvey can see our messages now.
TOMMY: That's about it.
|[1]YOU: Thanks, Tommy, wanna drop by later?|[0]YOU: I already knew that.|[0]YOU: Tommy, have you ever wanted to join a pyramid scheme?
{
TOMMY: Really? I thought you told me never to come back...but OK I'll be there!

TOMMY: No need to be rude now, Buddy.
}
{
TOMMY: You know, once I did-
TOMMY: I'll stop.
}
